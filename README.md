#### The Offices of the “Four Pillars”
The Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) is not only the ruling party in Vietnam but is also the only political party that exists legally in this country of nearly 100 million people. As in other communist countries, the VCP’s domination is written into the country’s constitution. There is no law that bans the formation of political parties but the authorities would arrest and imprison anyone who attempts to challenge the VCP’s monopoly. 

Since the Prime Minister oversees the most activities of the government, one would expect the Office of Government to have the largest budget among the four. But this is not the case. As Vietnam’s national income has increased at the rate of 5-7% in the last decade, one also expects the budgets of all four agencies to increase; yet our data shows a pattern of uneven increase under the leadership of the VCP’s General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong since 2011.

### Where Have All the Money Gone?

When we examine the budget of the Central Party Office, we also found evidence of a more active Trong. The actual expenditures are not available, but the planned expenditures of the CPO show an increase of 4 times in 7 years between 2008 and 2015, from nearly US$27 million (VND 622 billion) to about US$105 million USD (more than VND2400 billion).
